## 🚀 Overview

**Morse Vision** uses real-time video processing to detect eye blinks, classify them based on duration (short or long), and convert them into text using the Morse code system. This hands-free communication system is designed to assist people with disabilities, or serve as a secure communication layer in high-risk or silent environments.

## 🔍 Inspiration

> “During World War II, soldiers used Morse code to silently transmit critical information. That legacy inspired me to build a system that turns something as subtle as a blink into meaningful communication.”
